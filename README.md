```bash
$ node -v
```

## üå± How to start this project

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open:

```text
https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card.git
```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

To see the result in the browser, you will need to start the project by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
$ npm run start
```

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## Some context

As a web developer, you will be creating lots and lots of dynamic HTML using JavaScript based algorithms.

In this exercise, you have to create the HTML code needed to render a profile card based on a series of variables that could change in value during runtime. Here is an example of the profile card:

![Conditional Profile Card](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

Inside the `src/app.js` file there is a `render` function that receives variables and contains the logic to create most of the website HTML code.

```js
function render(variables = {}) {
  document.querySelector("#widget_content").innerHTML = `<div>Website code</div>`;
}
```

You can see the `variables` that are being generated by typing on the developer console: 

```js
console.log(window.variables);
/*
{
    includeCover: true, // if includeCover is true the algorithm should show the cover image
    background: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511974035430-5de47d3b95da", // this is the image's url that will be used as a background for the profile cover
    avatarURL: "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/42.jpg", // this is the url for the profile avatar
    socialMediaPosition: "left", // social media bar position (left or right)
    
    twitter: null, // social media usernames
    github: "alesanchezr",
    linkedin: null,
    instagram: null,

    name: null,
    lastName: null,
    role: null,
    country: null,
    city: null
}
*/
```

## üìù Instructions

These instructions come with a video for better understanding: https://youtu.be/gaVm8eyCqlM

1. Read and understand the `render` function and the value of the `variables` variable that it receives.

2. Change the content of the `render` function to make it render the variables on the card.

## üí° Attention!

You **do not** need to add any event listeners to the elements that are already built in the project. This is already being done by this part of the code:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll(".picker").forEach(function(elm) {
    elm.addEventListener("change", function(e) {
      // <- add a listener to every input
      const attribute = e.target.getAttribute("for"); // when any input changes, collect the value
      let values = {};
      values[attribute] =
        this.value == "" || this.value == "null"
          ? null
          : this.value == "true"
          ? true
          : this.value == "false"
          ? false
          : this.value;
      render(Object.assign(window.variables, values)); // render again the card with new values
    });
  });
```

So when the elements contents "change" they will already update the variable values for each element. All you need to do is to update the HTML content inside `render` function, as mentioned on instruction 1.

## Initial Variable Values

| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| includeCover | boolean | true | it determines if the cover shoud be visible with an image or not |
| background | string | null | the image's url that will be used as a background for the profile cover |
| avatarURL | string | null | the url for the profile avatar |
| socialMediaPosition | string | "right" | it can be `left` or `right` and it determines where to place the social media bar |
| twitter | string | null | the twitter username to be displayed on the profile |
| github | string | null | the github username to be displayed on the profile |
| linkedin | string | null | the linkedin username to be displayed on the profile |
| instagram | string | null | the instagram username to be displayed on the profile |
| name | string | null | The name of the user to be displayed on the profile |
| lastName | string | null | The name of the user to be displayed on the profile |
| role | string | null | The name of the user to be displayed on the profile |
| country | string | null | The name of the user to be displayed on the profile |
| city | string | null | the city of the user to be displayed on the profile |

## Hard-Coded HTML

This is an example of a possible HTML output, you will have to replace the name, last name, etc. With the values that these variables may have.

```html
<div class="widget">
  <div class="cover"><img src="https://the_url.com/for_the_background.png" /></div>
  <img src="https://the_url.com/for_the_image.png" class="photo" />
